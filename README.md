# Hamilton Beach Model #29881 Timer App

### App is hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://cafeandrew.github.io/bread/](https://cafeandrew.github.io/bread/)


-For one particular recipe, the machine's "Dough" mode rests the dough for 30 minutes too long

-To prevent incorrect rest times, this app calculates the timer setting you should use

-*This is useful for prepping the dough overnight for a certain time the next day (especially when the minutes don't match)*

-The app factors in the the 30 minute offset, but user still has to remove the dough at the designated time

-Yes, it's an easy enough calcuation. But I've goofed it when it's late!

## Notes

-User inputs the start time (can be blank if starting now) and the time the user needs the dough to be ready

-App prevents setting the timer beyond the machine's limit

-Designed to function as web app and saved to a phone.

-Save to your phone's home screen for easy access (through Safari or Chrome)
